üîç AI Misinformation Detector
"Empowering a more critical and informed digital citizenry."

üåü About the Project
This project is a full-stack, AI-powered tool designed to combat the rapid spread of misinformation in the digital world. Built for the Hackathon, our solution goes beyond simple fact-checking by not only identifying potentially misleading content but also educating users on the underlying reasons a piece of content might be untrustworthy.

üí° The Challenge
The rapid spread of fake news and misinformation across social media and messaging platforms poses a severe threat in India. This digital contagion can lead to social unrest, public health crises, and widespread financial scams. Our objective was to create an accessible tool that empowers users to quickly verify information and understand the manipulative techniques used to spread misleading content.
